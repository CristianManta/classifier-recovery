# Data Recovery from Classifiers
Our goal is to train a sampler from the class-conditioned distribution learned by a classifier. The code makes heavy use of the method presented in [Iterated Denoising Energy Matching for Sampling from Boltzmann Densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06121).

A copy of their code is available inside the [DEM](/DEM) directory in order to be able to import their modules. The authors' original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jarridrb/dem).
